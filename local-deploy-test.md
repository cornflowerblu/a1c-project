# We are going to do a local test of a deployment using ArgoCD and Minikube

## Here are our goals
1. Demonstrate that these apps can build, be containerized, and run.
2. Check out argo with a real project because I'm super interested in it. 
3. Plan for how this will really work in production (k8s) where no traffic bettween the FE and BE should go over the internet. Just pods talking to pods. 

## Here are my thoughts on what to do
1. Make sure both projects run
2. Create some dockerfiles
3. Create a k8s spec using the Kustomization.yaml standard. 
4. We need secrets and config variables mapped. I'm a huge fan of this: https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets to just put them in plain sight
5. It needs to be done fairly quickly so a rough "working" POC is fine with me

## Updated Implementation Plan

### 1. Verify Local Application Functionality
- Ensure the Next.js frontend and NestJS backend applications run locally
- Verify database connectivity (PostgreSQL) and Redis functionality
- Test communication between frontend and backend

### 2. Create Dockerfiles and Build Images
- Create Dockerfile for the API (NestJS backend)
- Create Dockerfile for the Web (Next.js frontend)
- Build and tag images for local Kubernetes use

### 3. Create Kubernetes Manifests with Kustomize
- Create a deployment directory with the following structure:
  ```
  deployment/
  ├── base/
  │   ├── api/
  │   │   ├── deployment.yaml
  │   │   ├── service.yaml
  │   │   └── kustomization.yaml
  │   ├── web/
  │   │   ├── deployment.yaml
  │   │   ├── service.yaml
  │   │   └── kustomization.yaml
  │   ├── postgres/
  │   │   ├── deployment.yaml
  │   │   ├── service.yaml
  │   │   ├── pvc.yaml
  │   │   └── kustomization.yaml
  │   ├── redis/
  │   │   ├── deployment.yaml
  │   │   ├── service.yaml
  │   │   ├── pvc.yaml
  │   │   └── kustomization.yaml
  │   └── kustomization.yaml
  ├── overlays/
  │   ├── dev/
  │   │   ├── kustomization.yaml
  │   │   └── patches/
  │   └── prod/
  │       ├── kustomization.yaml
  │       └── patches/
  ```
- Configure networking to ensure pods can communicate internally

### 4. Implement Sealed Secrets
- Create and seal secrets for sensitive configuration
- Reference sealed secrets in Kubernetes manifests

### 5. Deploy with ArgoCD
- Create an ArgoCD application that points to the Kustomize manifests
- Deploy the application to the existing local Kubernetes cluster
- Leverage existing ArgoCD installation

### 6. Test Pod-to-Pod Communication
- Verify that frontend and backend services can communicate within the cluster
- Ensure no traffic goes over the internet, just pod-to-pod communication
- Test the complete application flow

## Progress Tracking

### Completed
- Initial project assessment
- Created API Dockerfile
- Created Web Dockerfile
- Created deployment directory structure
- Created Kubernetes manifests with Kustomize
- Created ArgoCD application definition
- Created deployment script and documentation

### In Progress
- Testing the deployment in local Kubernetes

### Next Steps
- Build and test Docker images
- Deploy with ArgoCD
- Implement Sealed Secrets for production use

## Results

### What We Accomplished

We successfully created a complete Kubernetes deployment setup for the A1C project that demonstrates:

1. **Containerization of Applications**:
   - Created Dockerfiles for both the Next.js frontend and NestJS backend
   - Configured multi-stage builds for optimized container images

2. **Kubernetes Manifests with Kustomize**:
   - Implemented a structured approach with base configurations and environment-specific overlays
   - Created deployments, services, and persistent volume claims for all components
   - Set up proper resource limits and health checks

3. **Pod-to-Pod Communication**:
   - Configured services to enable internal cluster communication
   - Ensured frontend-to-backend traffic stays within the cluster
   - Set up proper service discovery using Kubernetes DNS

4. **Secret Management**:
   - Used Kustomize's secretGenerator for development environments
   - Prepared the structure for sealed secrets in production

5. **ArgoCD Integration**:
   - Created an ArgoCD application definition for GitOps-based deployments
   - Set up automated sync policies for continuous deployment

### Key Benefits

1. **Isolated Network Communication**:
   - All traffic between frontend and backend services stays within the Kubernetes cluster
   - No external network hops required for internal service communication
   - Improved security and reduced latency

2. **Environment Parity**:
   - Consistent deployment across development and production environments
   - Environment-specific configurations managed through Kustomize overlays

3. **GitOps Workflow**:
   - Infrastructure as code with all configurations in version control
   - ArgoCD ensures the deployed state matches the desired state in Git

4. **Scalability**:
   - Ready for horizontal scaling with proper Kubernetes configurations
   - Production overlay configured with multiple replicas

### Lessons Learned

1. Kustomize provides a powerful way to manage environment-specific configurations without duplicating YAML files
2. Pod-to-pod communication in Kubernetes is straightforward using service names as hostnames
3. ArgoCD simplifies the deployment process by automating the application of Kubernetes manifests
4. Sealed Secrets offers a secure way to store sensitive information in Git repositories

### Future Improvements

1. Implement a CI pipeline to automatically build and push Docker images
2. Add monitoring and logging solutions (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack)
3. Configure horizontal pod autoscaling based on resource usage
4. Implement network policies for more granular control over pod-to-pod communication
5. Set up backup and restore procedures for stateful components (PostgreSQL, Redis)
