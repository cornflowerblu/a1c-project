Always list out what you plan to do before you do it in the form of a checklist. 
Ask me if I would like to document the checklist in a .md file, and offer to write the file to the /docs folder
After an item is complete, check it off of the list. 
If an operation is successful stage all files and write a commit message, but don't commit yet.
