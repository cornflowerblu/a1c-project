Always list out what you plan to do before you do it in the form of a checklist. 
Stop execution after each checklist item is complete, and prompt me for if I would like to continue (Y/N)
If I decide to continue, check the completed item off of the list. 
At the end of the entire operation, ask me if I'd like to commit (Y/N)
If yes, stage the changed files, write a commit message, and commit
