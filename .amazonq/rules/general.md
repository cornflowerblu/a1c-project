Always list out what you plan to do before you do it in the form of a checklist. 
Stop execution after each checklist item is complete, and prompt me for if I would like to continue (Y/N)
If I decide to continue, check the completed item off of the list. 
If an operation is successful stage all files and write a commit message, but don't commit yet.
